### About this course

Data is the lifeblood of an organization. Competency in programming is an essential skill for successfully extracting information and knowledge from data.

The goal of this course is to introduce learners to the basics of programming in Python and to give a working knowledge of how to use programs to deal with data.

In this course, we will first cover the basics of programming and then focus on using Python on the entire data management process from data acquisition to analysis of data big data and small data.

This is an intensive hands-on course that will equip and reward learners with proficiency in data management skills.

### What you'll learn

  - Become familiar with working with relational databases, using SQL based languages such as MySql, dealing with formatted data (XML, JSON, etc.)
  
  - Use Python to work with and analyze data from databases as well as from the web

### Syllabus

  - Week 1: Python review
  
  - Week 2: Python review

  - Week 10: Analysis of networks
  
  - Week 11: Machine learning: Part 1
  
  - Week 12: Machine learning: Part 2

### Prerequisites

We will review basic Python programming concepts in week 1 and 2 and no prior programming experience is necessary. But, if you have had some exposure to programming you will get more out of this class.

No specific math capability is required though it will be helpful if you are familiar with the basic concepts of algebra, set theory, and probability.

## BAMM.103x: Demand and Supply Analytics

**[BAMM.103x: Demand and Supply Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/demand-and-supply-analytics "Course Description")**

Learn how to use data to develop insights and predictive capabilities to make better business decisions.

### About this course

How do airlines decide when to increase ticket prices? Should a hotel charge less per night for a long stay than a short one? Why do some software companies bundle very different products together? How should a fashion retailer decide when do start discounting clothes? Why do so many discounted rates end in ".99"? How should a company balance the risk of holding too much inventory on hand and the risk of turning away customers? Does it ever make sense for retailers to lie to suppliers about how much they will need to order? Should retailers with multiple locations hold most of their inventory in a central warehouse or at the individual locations?

These are only a small sample of the operational and pricing challenges all businesses regularly face. These challenges are often addressed individually and in isolation but, in reality, all of these decisions interact with each other. This class looks at the demand and supply management challenges faced by companies in various industries and provides an introduction to the tools that can be used to address these challenges.
